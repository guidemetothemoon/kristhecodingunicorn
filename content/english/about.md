Hey and welcome to my Tech Corner!

My name is Kris (obvously) and I have created this blog to share tech and non-tech (sometimes) stuff with the rest of the world :)
I live in Norway, love coding and strengthening security wherever possible. Currently I am working as Lead SW Architect and driving several exciting tech journeys that support digitalization journey in public and private sector, minimizing bureaucracy and making citizens' life easier.

As a person I love learning new things and sharing my discoveries with others. My biggest passion is to spread cybersecurity awareness in a humanly understandable, non-geek language to less technical audience - stay informed, stay protected, stay safe! ;)

On the personal side, I love photography, puzzles, board games, cats and unicorns. I am also actively supporting sustainable living and animal welfare and have been a vegetarian for over 8 years now. And I'm an eager hiker - photo below was taken in Jotunheimen National Park, one of the most scenic landscapes in Norway.

Anyway, thanks for stopping by! Check out the blog section and stay tuned for the coming updates.

See you there!
