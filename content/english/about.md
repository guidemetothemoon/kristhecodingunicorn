I'm Kris and I have created this blog to share tech stuff with the rest of the world ðŸ˜¸

I'm a techie from Norway, working as a platform engineer. I love learning new things and sharing back with the community. If you would like to have a chat about cloud native, open source (or anything tech-related basically), motorcycles or cats, don't be shy and drop me a message!ðŸ˜¸

> ðŸ’– Heartful thanks to all of you who are supporting animal shelters together with me - **YOU** help me help others and together we're making great deeds for the good of this planet. Currently **$480** went to support animal shelters and you may find the receipts here: [Donation Receipts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HxM52SrOuEskDQcGyWjB5A27k2el2Moj?usp=sharing)

> ðŸ™Œ If you would like to help me help animals in need you can donate through the [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/guidemetothemoon) page - 100% of contributions go to support local animal shelters here in Norway.

Thanks for stopping by! Check out the rest of the blog and subscribe to the RSS feed to stay tuned for the coming updates ðŸ¤—
