Heisann and welcome to my Tech Corner!

My name is Kris (obviously) and I have created this blog to share tech and non-tech (sometimes) stuff with the rest of the world ðŸ˜¸

I'm a techie from Norway who loves preaching about all things cloud native, Kubernetes, green tech and cats. I am working as a software architect and driving tech projects that support digitalization journey in public and private sector, minimizing bureaucracy and making citizens' life easier. I am also a Microsoft Azure MVP, CNCF ambassador and Kubernetes Unpacked podcast host.

I love learning new things and sharing my journey and experiences with others. My goal is to inspire others developers to code with sustainability, security and cloud native principles in mind. I also hope that with my actions and contributions I can inspire and motivate more ladies to join the world of tech!

I strongly believe that contributing to making this world a better place by volunteering is something all of us should consider doing, therefore being a volunteer is a big part of my life. Both when it comes to contributing back to tech community and non-profit organizations making a crucial positive impact in other areas of our life on this planet. 

I'm doing my part:

ðŸŒ± Supporter and contributor for multiple open-source projects on GitHub;

ðŸŒ± Board Member at Cloud Native Norway, NNUG Oslo and co-organizer of Cloud Native and Kubernetes Oslo and DEVREAL Oslo meetups;

ðŸŒ± Community Advocate at StreamingClouds;

ðŸŒ± Volunteer at OWASP;

ðŸŒ± Mentor at TENK Tech Camp Oslo, GirlCode and Women in Tech;

ðŸŒ± Volunteer at animal shelter;

On a personal note, I love reading books, photography, puzzles, board games, drawing and hiking. I am an active supporter of sustainability in tech and outside of it, and animal welfare. I'm #VeganInTech and an eager nature addict as well - photo below was taken in Oslofjord area, one of the most known inlets in the Eastern Norway, which is known for a multitude of idyllic towns and villages that are full of exploration opportunities for the tourists.

Anyway, thanks for stopping by! Check out the blog and tech tips section and stay tuned for the coming updates. â˜• ðŸ¦¾

See you there! ðŸ¤—
