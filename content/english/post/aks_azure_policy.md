üêá***This blog post is also a contribution to Azure Spring Clean 2023 where during 5 weekdays of March, 13th-17th, community contributors will share learning resources that highlight best-practices, lessons learned, and help with some of the more difficult topics of Azure Management. You're welcome to check out all the contributions here:*** [Azure Spring Clean 2023](https://www.azurespringclean.com)

As you may know already, Kubernetes doesn't come with 100% built-in security by default. The same applies for managed Kubernetes service like AKS. Some cloud providers offer more hardened default configuration for a managed Kubernetes, some offer less hardened and more beginner-friendly default configuration, but the fact stays the fact - cloud services are a shared responsibility. It means that you're responsible to properly harden and secure Kubernetes clusters that you're provisioning, also in Azure.

**But is there a way that can help you make this process easier and ensure continuous complliance?**

There is a way indeed, and it's called Azure Policy. Now let's dig into what Azure Policy is and how it can be applied to AKS. üòº

## Azure Policy for Kubernetes

## Enforcing Azure Policy definitions

### Azure Portal

### Terraform (IaC)

## Custom Azure Policy definitions

## Additional resources
