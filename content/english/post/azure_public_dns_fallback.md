Towards the end of 2024 Microsoft announced new configuration opportunity for Azure Private DNS zones called fallback to Internet. I think that it was announced more or less right after the 2024 Microsoft Ignite event. This functionality is at the point of writing this blog post still in preview so proceed with caution ðŸ˜¼

I've started working with it shortly after it was released, and I would like to share some thoughts and use cases here where utilizing this functionality can make sense, and how you can implement it yourself.

## How does it work?

Fallback to Internet for private DNS zones can prove very handy when you're utilizing private endpoints, especially in a multi-region scenario. Let's take a look at a typical example workflow for creating a private endpoint for an Azure Key Vault (the same workflow is applicable for any other Azure resource that supports private endpoints):

1. Create a private DNS zone that will contain records mapping every Key Vault behind private endpoint to its private IP address. Normally it will be called `privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net`.
2. Create a virtual network link between the private DNS zone and a virtual network that will provision private IP addresses for the respective private endpoints.
3. Create a private endpoint in the respective virtual network subnet and connect it to the Azure Key Vault resource.
4. Disable public network access on the respective Azure Key Vault.

Once private endpoint is configured and enabled, DNS resolution workflow to the key vault will look something like the image below. Here I've chosen to illustrate how it will look like if you have a hub-spoke network topology, but you can check how the same flow will look like with a single virtual network in Microsoft documentation: [Azure Private Endpoint DNS integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-dns-integration#virtual-network-workloads-without-azure-private-resolver)

![Diagram of DNS resolution flow for an Azure Key Vault private endpoint in a hub-spoke network topology](../../images/azure_dns/azure-private-endpoint-hub-spoke-dns-flow.webp)

DNS query for the key vault `kv-dev-neu.vaultcore.azure.net` reaches Azure-managed DNS service **(1)**, where it's resolved further via Azure-managed recursive resolver as a CNAME for the resource's private endpoint: `kv-dev-neu.privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net` **(2)**. Next, the endpoint FQDN is being resolved further to a private IP for the resource via the private DNS zone for Azure Key Vault: `privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net`, which we created in step 1 in the beginning of this section. Resolved private IP address for the private endpoint is returned back to the Azure-managed DNS service: `10.0.0.7` (3). The resolved private IP address is sent further from the Azure-managed DNS service to the caller which is a virtual machine in our example: `vm-dev-neu` (4). From there onwards the connection from the virtual machine to the respective key vault is happening over the private endpoint's private IP address (5).

This example workflow is not exhaustive - depending on what resources you would like to put behind private endpoints and what kind of architecture you have in place you may need to do additional steps, like creating virtual network peerings, setting up private DNS resolvers, virtual network gateway for a hybrid cloud scenario, etc. Private endpoint implementation for different scenarios can be a dedicated blog post in itself ðŸ˜…

The main point here is that once all the above steps are done and the Azure Key Vault is only accessible via private endpoint and its private IP address, **all of the queries attempting to reach the key vault will only be resolvable by the respective private DNS zone**.

TODO: add better clarification on connection to private DNS zones in every region which causes resolution issues.

But, what if you would like to whitelist a specific public IP address, for example for a build agent to be able to access the key vault? Maybe you have a multi-region setup where a virtual machine from a different region needs access to this specific Key Vault and you don't want (or can't) implement full-blown interconnected multi-regional setup for private endpoints with virtual network peerings, but instead would like to just whitelist the IP of that virtual machine on the Key Vault networking level?

Originally that wouldn't be easy to achieve out of the box and would require you to make larger infrastructure changes and potentially increase complexity by introducing cross-regional virtual network peering for instance.

That's where the fallback to internet functionality comes into picture. By enabling this configuration setting, you can support scenarios where access via private endpoint isn't possible, but the resource behind private endpoint can still be reached over the internet by the whitelisted IP addresses, while all the other traffic still flows through the private endpoint.

Building on the earlier example - let's say we have a virtual machine in Norway East region that needs access to our key vault in North Europe that is now behind a private endpoint. With fallback to internet setting enabled, the DNS ...

In my use case there was a multi-regional setup where every region operated in isolation, but there was a specific, common resource in one of the regions that needed access to some of the resources behind the private endpoints in a different region. An option here would've been to introduce cross-regional virtual network peering, but it wasn't applicable in my use case due to security restrictions and the undesirable additional complexity that this change could bring. Utilizing this functionality actually made it pretty quick and simple for me to resolve this challenge and whitelist the IP of the resource that needed access to the resources behind the private endpoint, while still enforcing resolution of all the other traffic to the respective private IP address.

## How to enable it?

Configuration option for this functionality is available in API version `2024-06-01` or higher. At the point of writing this blog post it was unfortunately not available in the Azure Verified Module for private DNS zone or in the AzureRM provider for Terraform, but there are a few options on how you can configure it anywayðŸ˜¸

This functionality can be configured during creation of the virtual network link in the private DNS zone or by editing existing virtual network link.

### Bicep

Fallback to internet can be configured on the virtual network resource by setting `resolutionPolicy` value to `NxDomainRedirect`, as shown in the code snippet below.

``` terraform
// virtual-network-link.bicep

param dnsZoneName string
param tags object
param vnetId string

resource dnsZone 'Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones@2024-06-01' existing = {
  name: dnsZoneName
}

resource vnetLink 'Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/virtualNetworkLinks@2024-06-01' = {
    parent: dnsZone
    name: '${dnsZone.name}-vnetlink'
    location: 'global'
    tags: resourceTags
    properties: {
        registrationEnabled: false
        resolutionPolicy: 'NxDomainRedirect' // <-- enable fallback to Internet
        virtualNetwork: {
            id: vnetId
        }
    }
}

```

### Terraform

It's also not yet available in the AzureRM provider for Terraform, but you can configure it with AzAPI provider like this:

``` terraform

```

### Azure CLI

``` shell
az network private-dns link vnet create --name <virtual_network_link_name> --resource-group <private_dns_zonre_resource_group_name> --virtual-network <virtual_network_name> --zone-name <private_dns_zone_name> --registration-enabled False --resolution-policy NxDomainRedirect

az network private-dns link vnet update --name <virtual_network_link_name> --resource-group <private_dns_zonre_resource_group_name> --zone-name <private_dns_zone_name> --resolution-policy NxDomainRedirect
```

You can also go the classic way and configure it via Azure portal (also on existing private DNS zones) - check out the first linked article in the session below for more information on how to do that!
