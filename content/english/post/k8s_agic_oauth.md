This blog post is a continuation of an extensive blog post about OAuth2 Proxy, which I published earlier: [Setting Up OAuth 2.0 Authentication for Applications in AKS With NGINX and OAuth2 Proxy](https://kristhecodingunicorn.com/post/k8s_nginx_oauth). In the original blog post NGINX Ingress Controller was deployed in AKS clusters, while this blog post will look into how authentication with OAuth2 Proxy can be implemented when AKS clusters are configured with Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC). Multiple steps for setting up OAuth2 Proxy are similar to the ones described in the original blog post, therefore those will be linked here directly to avoid content duplication. To get most value out of this content I will strongly recommend to check out the original blog post or links to its specific sections that will be provided as part of this blog post.
