Have you already seen "Automatic upgrade" property when creating a new AKS cluster in Azure Portal?

Auto-upgrade of an AKS cluster is actually **not** a new functionality and has been available since January 2021. It is just recently it has been made configurable from the Azure Portal, when you create a new AKS cluster.

Before we dive into what auto-upgrade functionality can do for us let's take a look at why we need to bother about upgrading AKS clusters we create and why it's important to do it frequently and continuously.

## Why upgrading AKS clusters is important?

I've seen quite a few misunderstandings and misconceptions related to the upgrade process for AKS clusters and Kubernetes clusters in general. Both when it comes to upgrading the cluster to a new Kubernetes version and upgrading a node image to a new OS version and/or to get newest patches and fixes. I've seen many organizations running their workloads on clusters with Kubernetes version that was 2-4 versions older than the latest GA version.

**So, why can lacking cluster upgrade routine become an issue?**
