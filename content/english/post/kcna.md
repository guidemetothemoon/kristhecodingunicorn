For some time ago I successfully passed a Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA) certification exam from CNCF and The Linux Foundation, and in this blog post I would like to share a few resources I've used for preparation, as well as a few personal experiences from the certification exam and format, that I hope can be useful for others who are getting ready for the exam üò∫

## What is KCNA?

Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA) is one of the beginner-level certifications that verifies your fundamental knowledge of cloud native technologies. Significant part of the certification is dedicated to Kubernetes, its architecture and core components, but it also covers areas like containerization, GitOps and fundamental cloud native security.

KCNA certification is valid for 3 years and can be a good preparation for more advanced certification exams like CKAD, CKA and CKS.

## KCNA exam format

KCNA exam is an online, proctored exam that lasts for 90 minutes. It's a multiple choice type exam with 60 questions, where you only have questions with a single correct answer, i.e. there are no multi-choice questions. I've completed my exam in 30 minutes, but this is because I've worked with Kubernetes and cloud native technologies for some time now, but I do believe that 90 minutes should be enough time if you're a beginner and have invested some time for preparations.

Once you complete the exam you will not get your results straight away. You should receive your results approximately 24 hours after the exam and from my experience, it **will** take no less than 24 hours so there's no need for you to refresh your e-mail any earlier than that üòÅ
