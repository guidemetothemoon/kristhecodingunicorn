{{< table_of_contents >}}

For over a week ago, 18th-21st of April, KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Europe was happening in Amsterdam in the Netherlands and it was HUGE! With a fully sold out event, with more than 10 000 participants, it has been the largest conference I've attended in-person so far. I attended the event wearing many hats: a speaker, KCD organizer, CNCF ambassador and an attendee. Having these roles gave me an even broader perspective of the event which I want to share with the communityðŸ˜º

I have also done a re-cap of the event together with Michael Levan in our new Kubernetes Unpacked podcast episode, where we talked about not only the latest and greatest technologies that are coming, but also about the top three takeaways from KubeCon+CloudNativeCon that you should remember when implementing Kubernetes in production. The episode is available here: []()

## General overview



## Trends and session highlights

## Takeaways and tips

There are some reflections and tips that I gathered from attending KubeCon+CloudNativeCon in multiple roles and I hope that some of these reflections can be insightful for you or even inspire you to attend next time, maybe in a new role apart from attendeeðŸ˜‰

### Attendee

### Speaker

### CNCF Ambassador

CNCF Ambassadors are an extension of CNCF, furthering the mission of "making cloud native ubiquitous" through community leadership and mentorship.
CNCF Ambassadors are elected twice per year and anyone can apply. If you're contributing back to the cloud native and open source community by creating technical content, organizing events, speaking or mentoring, you should consider applying for the program. Here's a summary of Spring 2023 election which was the first term I got accepted to: [Introducing our Spring 2023 Cloud Native Ambassadors! ](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/04/19/introducing-our-spring-2023-cloud-native-ambassadors)

KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Europe was a great opportunity to meet fellow ambassadors from all over the world and engage in interesting discussions around cloud native technologies, content creation and community contribution. It's also a great arena to brainstorm new content and collaborate on creating some of that content together. 

Another reflection I really want to share is ***the atmosphere of inclusion***. I'm an introvert and am not always mastering social events and get-to-know parties in a good way, therefore attending events where I don't know that many people can quickly become challenging. As part of the conference I attended an Ambassador breakfast for all the CNCF Ambassadors, where I didn't know that many just yet. As I was about to sit down for myself, a few other ambassadors spotted it and invited me to their table, which was very sweet and nice of them to do. I would like to send these kind fellow ambassadors a shoutout and a warm Thank You for including me in their company - people like you give me even more inspiration to do the same when I see someone who may feel lonely or uncomfortable at community eventsðŸ’–

### KCD Organizer

Kubernetes Community Days (KCD) are smaller versions of KubeCon+CloudNativeCon that are arranged by tech community members all over the globe, with support from CNCF. The goal of these events is to foster collaboration, networking, knowledge sharing around topics of open source, cloud native and Kubernetes in the local tech communities. 

Any city can arrange a KCD and there's a helpful checklist with extensive information available on GitHub that can come in handy if you consider arranging a KCD event yourself at some point: [cncf/kubernetes-community-days](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days).

During KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Europe there were multiple opportunities to engage with fellow KCD organizers, both new and experienced ones. There was a booth available where at any time you could go and have a chat with some of the KCD organizers about anything around event planning, tips and tricks, etc.

When the recordings from the conference become available I would recommend you to check out following session: ***"Grow Your Own Community! Lessons Learned from Running Kubernetes Community Days Across Europe - Matt Jarvis, Snyk; Annalisa Gennaro, SparkFabrik; Max Korbacher, Liquid Reply; Alessandro Vozza, Solo.io; Paula Kennedy, Syntasso"***. This was a very interesting panel discussion where organizers from some of the biggest Kubernetes Community Days in Europe shared their experiences, challenges, pitfalls, tips and tricks when it comes to organizing such community events at scale.

Myself, together with a few amazing community members, will be arranging KCD Norway in January 2024 so if you're planning a trip to Oslo or would like to speak at our event, do reach out! All the updates regarding the event will be published at [CNCF - KCD Norway](https://community.cncf.io/kcd-norway), so stay tuned!ðŸ˜¼

That's it from me this time, thanks for checking in!ðŸ’–
