KubeCon+CloudNativeCon North America 2023 is under a week away and I thought I would use this opportunity to share some of the personal reflections for the upcoming event, as well as highlight some of the sessions that I personally am looking forward to watching.

Myself and Michael have also chatted about the event at Kubernetes Unpacked podcast - do check out this episode as well: [KubeCon NA 2023 Prep](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/kubernetes-unpacked-)

This time I'll be joining the event virtually, but this doesn't take away the fact that the event agenda is quite large and can at times be a little bit overwhelming...as alwaysðŸ˜… After using some time to go through the agenda I can say that there will be quite many sessions on security - there will be both "formal" sessions, Capture The Flag (CTF) and Unconference sessions where participants will choose themselves which topics from the list they want to have a discussion about. Previously there was a Security Village at KubeCon+CloudNativeCon EU, but now it's called a **Security Hub**.

There will also be an **AI Hub**, which is new - it will be purely in Unconference format and touch upon topics of LLMs, AI policy, AI operations, AI data governance and usage of AI in organizations in general. In general I feel that, even compared to the EU event which was half a year ago, there's a significantly larger presence of sessions related to AI and Machine Learning in context of Kubernetes in the NA event, which is not surprising if we look at how rapidly the artificial intelligence space has evolved. There will also be a pre-day event dedicated to Kubernetes AI and high-performance computing (HPC).

While we are on the topic of pre-day, co-located events I would like to highlight AppDeveloperCon which is a new type of co-located event hosted by CNCF. This event is specifically targeting application developers and will cover topics related to the architecture, design, and development of cloud native applications. Another co-located event I'd like to highlight is DBaaS DevDay which is all about development and utilization of cloud native databases and how it fits into the cloud native ecosystem and Kubernetes. By now we know that running stateful workloads on Kubernetes is totally possible, as long as you have a meaningful use case for itðŸ˜‰

Some sessions and activities I personally am looking forward to:

- [Environmental Sustainability in the Cloud Is Not a Mythical Creature](https://sched.co/1R4Tl) keynote where the panel will discuss initiatives to monitor and address sustainability-related challenges in technology sector. Some of my fellow [TAG Environmental Sustainability](https://tag-env-sustainability.cncf.io/) members will also be part of the panel.

- [15,000 Minecraft Players Vs One K8s Cluster. Who Wins?](https://sched.co/1R2lz) session which is super interesting in terms of how to run at scale and scale fast on bare metal Kubernetes infrastructure.
