KubeCon+CloudNativeCon North America 2023 is under a week away and I thought I would use this opportunity to share some of the personal reflections for the upcoming event, as well as highlight some of the sessions that I personally am looking forward to watching.

Myself and Michael have also chatted about the event at Kubernetes Unpacked podcast - do check out this episode as well: [KubeCon NA 2023 Prep](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/kubernetes-unpacked-)
